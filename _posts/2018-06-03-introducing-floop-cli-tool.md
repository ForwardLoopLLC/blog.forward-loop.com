title: 'Introducing Floop: Run Code on Multiple ARM Devices'
---

Last week, we released the documentation for <a href="https://docs.forward-loop.com/floopcli/master/index.htmll)" target="_blank">floop</a>. Floop allows developers to run code on multiple ARM devices at the same time. For prototyping and testing software applications across different types of devices, floop is a standardized way of pushing, building, running and testing code.

To show off what floop can do, we ran C++, Python, and Go on four different ARM devices at the same time.
