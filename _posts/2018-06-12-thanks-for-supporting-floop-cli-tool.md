title: Thanks for Supporting Floop
---

We open-sourced [floop](https://docs.forward-loop.com/floopcli/master/index.html) to share a tool that lets embedded developers standardize how they push and run code across different types of devices. Along the way, we never expected such positive feedback from the embedded community. Thanks to your support, floop reached more than 500 downloads in its first week!

For anyone interested in building and running embedded applications faster, we encourage you to try floop and build on [Forward Loop Zero](https://forward-loop.com/product.html).

We would love to hear what you think of the floop cli tool. Feel free to reach out directly via [email](mailto:mike@mail.forward-loop.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelortolano/).
