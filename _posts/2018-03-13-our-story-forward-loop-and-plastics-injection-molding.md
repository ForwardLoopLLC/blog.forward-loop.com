title: 'Our Story: Forward Loop and Plastic Injection Molding'
---

We started Forward Loop to help plastics manufacturers improve their understanding of how their machines work and why they sometimes don’t. We believe that the factory of the future looks just like your shop floor now, fitted with easy-to-use sensors and monitoring equipment that you can afford, understand, and rely on every day.

Before building our first product to help create that future, we noticed a few key things about the industry that influenced us. Here’s a list of the four major realizations that helped develop Forward Loop:

1. **There’s more than one way to connect to the Internet**

    Most internet technologies take for granted that everyone always has access to a high-speed wifi connection. While this assumption might work for the office-bound 9-to-5 crowd, it falls short  for most manufacturing facilities and shop floors.  At Forward Loop, we’ve hurdled  the barrier of factory wifi coverage by building a product that connects to the Internet anywhere you have cellular coverage.

2. **Products for manufacturers should fit all machines, small and big, new and old.**

    At Forward Loop, we know plastics manufacturers run machines of all different sizes, brands, configurations, and models, so one-size-fits-all is a must to keep track of the moving parts on a factory floor. Our product fits and continuously monitors any injection molding machine, whether purchased and installed in 2018 or 1978.

3. **Manufacturers spend too much valuable time waiting for, installing, and being trained on new equipment.**

    For most of the injection molding industry buying new equipment means waiting weeks for its arrival, investing a lot time and energy in learning a complicated control, and teaching operators and maintenance support how it all works. At Forward Loop, we set out to build a product that could be air shipped in less than a week and installed in under 15 minutes without any training to get up and running.

4. **Plastics injection machinery monitoring usually focuses on the injection unit while overlooking the mechanics of the machine.**

    Injection molding is a complicated process, so process monitoring and control systems have become more and more popular in the industry. Most of these tools give manufacturers a better understanding of what their injection units are doing. While it is extremely important to keep tabs on how the injection process is going, this focus leaves other machine maintenance issues hidden in plain sight. Making good parts without breaking machines also requires keeping tracking of the molds, platens, gears, and other moving parts on the machine. At Forward Loop, we believe there are opportunities to help manufacturers make better preventative maintenance decisions by continuous, real-time monitoring of the mechanics of machinery. 
		
These four realizations are the backbone of our company and our first product, MoldMonitor, delivering mold cycle count reports direct from sensor to email inbox.
