title: Launching MoldMonitor, Continuous Monitoring for Molds
---

With the recent end to Forward Loop's factory testing, we are happy to announce our first continuous monitoring product, MoldMonitor, a connected sensor that fits your mold and your budget.

MoldMonitor attaches to the mold of a plastic injection molding machine without requiring factory wifi connectivity, lengthy installation, or training. The sensor continuously monitors your moldâ€™s cycle count, and delivers an email notification whenever a mold runs for a specified number of cycles. MoldMonitor protects against over-running your molds, and makes mold preventative maintenance planning easy.
