title: Rapid Prototyping and Testing in Factories in China
---

We launched Forward Loop at the very start of 2018. Within two months we built our first product prototypes that were ready for testing. At the end of February we headed up to Ningbo, China, a city just two hours south of Shanghai to put our sensors on live machines in a running factory.

In total, we ran six sensors across three different machines of two different press sizes (two 860 ton and one 3000 ton) for four whole days.

The prototypes tested all of the workhorse hardware that senses, monitors, processes, stores, and communicates information about the moving machines. While they may not be much to look at now, each sensor successfully processed movement data 200 times per second for the entire test period. This first batch of sensors passed the hardware and software tests with flying colors.

We are now working to package the hardware so its look and feel matches what it can do.

Special thanks to Leon Xie for getting us into the factory in Ningbo, and Vinny Ortolano for the prototype enclosure design.
